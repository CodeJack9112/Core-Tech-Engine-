Native Code::Blocks project generated by assistant:

- CoreTech_Engine_native.cbp : native Code::Blocks project that lists all .cpp/.h files
- CoreTech_Engine_native.workspace : workspace referencing the native project

Notes:
- This native project attempts to compile sources directly inside Code::Blocks using the
  selected compiler (MinGW/GCC or other). You may still need to set include paths and
  linker libraries in the Code::Blocks project options (Project -> Build options) to match
  the original CMake configuration (third-party libs like Bullet, OpenAL, etc.).
- If you prefer the CMake-driven project (recommended), use the previously provided
  CoreTech_Engine.cbp which runs CMake as part of its build steps.
