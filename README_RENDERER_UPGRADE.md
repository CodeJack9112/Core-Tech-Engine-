Renderer upgraded: material component, shader helper, asset manager (tinyobj + stb_image), scene JSON extended,
and ImGui editor now exposes material editing and a basic asset folder.

Note: tinyobjloader and stb are fetched only when FETCH_DEPS=ON. The system remains guarded so offline builds still configure.
